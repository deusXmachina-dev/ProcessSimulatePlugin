Chapter 1: The Who, the What, and the Why

We’re currently a team of two:
	-@pungys97
	-@FilipKubis

Both proudly from Czechia, both software engineers with a shared origin story in mechanical engineering and robotics.
We started with robots, drifted into software — because, well, software is fun… but robots are funnerer 🤖💥

We’re generally optimistic folks, though a bit frustrated with the current industry mood in Europe. There’s a ton of cool stuff to be built, and this project is our first step toward building the tools — and the feedback loops — to make that happen.

Our Mission

We’re building developer tools for industrial engineers.
Our first project: an energy optimization tool for robots (details coming soon).

Here’s the catch: industry desperately needs good software engineers…
but anyone who can code usually jumps ship to software — because of the 💰 (fair enough).
We’ve seen this pattern again and again among our robotics friends at uni.

The European Industry Rant™

Everyone says industry in Europe is dying — and honestly, it feels that way sometimes.
Which sucks, because this continent invented industry.

The struggle?
	•	Expensive inputs (energy 💸 — “green” power, but sadly not Hulk green)
	•	Costly labor
	•	Shifting work ethics (we actually like the idea of a 4-day work week — but it only works when productivity keeps up)
	•	Declining population

Put it all together and, well… we’re kinda cooked.

The way out?
👉 Either innovate like crazy
👉 Or fix the demographics (more shabonking — though that part’s not going on GitHub 😅)
