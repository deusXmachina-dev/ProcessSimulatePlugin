## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Setup Your Simulation**
   - Open your Process Simulate project
   - Ensure your digital twins are properly configured
   - Run your baseline simulation to establish the current takt time

2. **Run Energy Optimization**
   - Select the robots/operations you want to optimize
   - Launch the Energy Optimization command from the menu
   - Configure optimization parameters (target takt time, energy constraints, etc.)

3. **Review Results**
   - Analyze the optimization suggestions
   - Review the energy savings report
   - Compare optimized vs. baseline performance

4. **Apply Changes**
   - Accept the suggested motion profile changes
   - Re-run the simulation to verify results
   - Export the optimized program for deployment

### Configuration Options

*(Details about configuration parameters will be added here)*

### Tips & Best Practices

- Start with non-critical cells to familiarize yourself with the tool
- Always verify that takt time requirements are met after optimization
- Document your baseline performance before applying changes
